# HOW TO UPLOAD GIT REPOSITORY to GITHUB

# STEP 1 change directory to where you want to initialize repository
cd path/to/your/directory/here

# STEP 2 see which files to modified and staged for commit
git status

#STEP 3 add files to staging are
git add name_of_file
git add . to add all files in the folder

#STEP 4 all added items can now commit
git commit -m " your_message_here "

#STEP 5 will move all your files from local repository to remote repository(github)
git push origin name_of_your_branch


#ADDITIONAL:

# git branch
to check your current branch / branches

# git remote -v
to check your remote URL

# git log    git log --oneline
shows the commit history of the current branch, including commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes. 
It's useful for understanding the history of changes in your repository.

# git pull origin name_of_your_branch
git pull to fetch and merge those changes into your local repository.

# git fetch name_of_your_branch
similar to git pull, retrieves changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't automatically merge them into your local branch

# git checkout name_of_your_branch
used to switch branches or restore files from an older commit. 

# git merge other_branch_name
merge changes from another branch into your current branch

# git rm name_of_your_file     ex. excel.xlsx
remove files from the working directory and staging area

# git help
